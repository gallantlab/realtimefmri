Scanning
========

Real-time experiments have a lot of moving parts, so here's a step-by-step list of how to get one up and running.


Prior to scanning
-----------------

1. Configure a :ref:`preprocessing pipeline <pipelines>`.


During the scanning session
---------------------------

2. Follow the instructions for how to :ref:`acquire DICOM images in real-time<network>`.
3. Configure the software to listen for TTLs on the correct device. Find which device the USB is connected to using ``ls -l /dev/event/by-id``. Set ``EVENT_DEVICE=/dev/input/event<device number>`` in the ``.env`` file.
4. Run ``make docker.up`` to start the real-time fMRI software.
